# Brazil-E-Commerce-EDA

This notebook aims to present an analytical perspective on the e-commerce landscape in Brazil. The analysis begins with an exploratory data analysis using graphical tools to create informative and easy-to-understand plots. Subsequently, customer reviews are analyzed using Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing techniques to classify the text into sentiment categories. This approach enables us to gain insights into the Brazilian online purchasing behavior and customer sentiment, which can be valuable for businesses operating in this market.
